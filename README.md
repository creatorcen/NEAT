# **NEAT**

My name is Tom, and I have a great interest in AI algorithms,
specifically in genetic algorithms, and their implementations.

I'm just starting to learn Git, and my first project will be to try
and implement the NEAT algorithm based off of this http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf paper.

I've had some experience with neuroevolution before, I made the common
bugs trying to survive simulation using Processing and java.

This time I will be implementing NEAT, only in text though, no graphics.
Later on I might add a simulation for NEAT to solve. Baby steps!
